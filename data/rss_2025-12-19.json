    "title": "What the Health? From KFF Health News: Time\u2019s Up for Expanded ACA Tax Credits",
    "summary": "A last-minute push from Democrats and four moderate Republicans will force a House vote on renewing enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans, but not until January. That means millions will have to choose between paying dramatically more or dropping coverage next year. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially drops the federal recommendation for newborns to receive a hepatitis B shot. Tami Luhby of CNN, Alice Miranda Ollstein of Politico, and Lizzy Lawrence of Stat join KFF Health News\u2019 Julie Rovner to discuss those stories and more. Also this week, Rovner interviews Tony Leys, who wrote the latest \u201cBill of the Month\u201d feature, and the panel discusses the year\u2019s biggest developments in health policy.",
